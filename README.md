# GMapsRedirect

Redirect GMaps URLs to geo URIs.

This app can open various link types leading to Google Maps, resolve the coordinates of the objects they're leading to, and redirect you to a geo URI containing this coordinates.

### Disclaimer & Contributing

This is a very low-effort side project primarily for personal usage.

I will **not** be actively supporting it in the future, probably just keeping the bare minimum functionality to make it work.

Feel free to use as is (see [Releases](https://github.com/honsiorovskyi/GMapsRedirect/releases/latest) for the APK), or if you have time and will to make something better out of it, please feel free to fork and do so :)
